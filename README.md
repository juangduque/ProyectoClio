# Proyecto Clio
Clio is a CRUD-type application that supports the management of home orders for the company "Cubanos", which is a fast food restaurant.
This application solves the problem of having to request the necessary data to take a home order every time a customer calls to place an order. The necessary data are: 
- Name.
- Direction.
- Phone.
- Floor (where the client lives if it is necessary).
- Other indications (Some clients have particular specifications). 

The task of requesting this data each time a customer calls takes considerable time, so Clio was initially thought of. With Clio the customer only has to give the data the first time he calls.
